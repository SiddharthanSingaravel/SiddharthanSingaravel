Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm Siddharth, a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience in US Healthcare and Finance. Right now, I'm diving deeper into Analytics as a graduate student at Northeastern, MA.

As an engineer/pop-math enthusiast/analyst, the idea that we can harness data to find patterns, predict outcomes, and make smarter decisions fascinates me. With the rise of modern statistical methods (a.k.a Data Science), it's interesting to note how the poignant issues of our time could be addressed using math (read Linear Algebra). It's impressive to think we now have tools that tackle non-deterministic problems with a reasonable amount of confidence. Whether itâ€™s optimizing sales-rep strategies for pharma firms or finding patterns in customer behavior in finance, the applications are endlessâ€”and that's what keeps me hooked.

When I worked at ZoomRx, I had the opportunity to work with Fortune 500 pharma firms helping them refine how their sales rep teams connect with Physicians. Additionally, I built predictive models classifying healthcare providers, worked on tools parsing clinical trial info, ran A/B tests on marketing content, automated data pipelines, and was part of a few other exciting projects. 

At Fidelity, I focused on developing models to forecast customer unsubscription proclivity, and designing dashboards to visualize key customer traffic metrics.
